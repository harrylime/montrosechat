After building, serve the `/resources/php/ip` directory over HTTP. If your main domain is cached by a CDN, you will want to use an uncached subdomain to reference the script. If you do this, you must have a permissive CORS policy. This is accomplished under Apache via:

    <Location /resources/php/ip>
      Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    </Location>

or similar. Don't forget to change the reference to "http://video.montrose.is/resources/php/ip/" in the chat client's `index.html` to the real value for your (sub)domain.
