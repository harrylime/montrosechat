klyton uses inotifywait to achieve zero CPU idle times. The `WeatherInfo` and `UrlInfo` portions are launched separately:

    inotifywait -e moved_to -m $PATHTO/klyton/queues/weatherinfo/ | ./WeatherInfo &
    inotifywait -e moved_to -m $PATHTO/klyton/queues/urlinfo/ | ./UrlInfo &

Where `$PATHTO` is the path to the `klyton` configuration directory.

Next, launch klyton itself:

    ./Klyton &

To connect the the `WeatherInfo` and `UrlInfo` programs with klyton, first discover what port klyton is listening on:

    cat $PATHTO/klyton/config/inotify_port

And then launch a listening task referencing to that port number:

    inotifywait -e moved_to -m $PATHTO/klyton/queues/klyton/ | while read file; do echo "$file" | nc 127.0.0.1 XXXXX; done &

where XXXXX is number from `cat`ing the `inotify_port`.
