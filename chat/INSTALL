Serve the directory containing this file via HTTP. The server must properly serve `.svgz` files with the `image/svg+xml` mime type. On Apache, this is accomplished by adding:

    AddType image/svg+xml svg svgz
    AddEncoding gzip svgz

To the appropriate `Directory` directive. The same server should reverse proxy an instance of `websocketd` tied to `nc`:

    ./websocketd --address=127.0.0.1 --port=8080 nc irc.montrose.is 6667
 
Under Apache, this is done with a `Location` directive:

    <Location /irc>
      ProxyPass ws://127.0.0.1:8080
      ProxyPassReverse ws://127.0.0.1:8080
    </Location>

If `/irc` isn't available, you will need to modify `Chat.hx` appropriately.

The client also needs the `/ip/` PHP script available on the same server (otherwise the IP's listed are likely to be inaccurate. See the `INSTALL` file in the `ip` directory.

Advanced features actually depend on the `klyton` IRC bot. See the `INSTALL` file in the `klyton` directory.
